# Articulated_Arm_For_Webcam
Articulated Arm made for mounting and moving a webcam for better recording angles.

## ABOUT
This articulated arm is made to be printed and assembled using easy to acquire hardware, and is meant for mounting of a webcam or any other small form camera (Like a GoPro) for easy camera movement and scene capturing.
I made it to be compatible with regular webcams, but anyone downloading this is free to Remix it and modify it to either make it stronger to support heavier cameras, or make different mounts for other cameras.
