# Articulated_Arm_For_Webcam
Articulated Arm made for mounting and moving a webcam for better recording angles.

## ABOUT
This articulated arm is made to be printed and assembled using easy to acquire hardware, and is meant for mounting of a webcam or any other small form camera (Like a GoPro) for easy camera movement and scene capturing.
I made it to be compatible with regular webcams, but anyone downloading this is free to Remix it and modify it to either make it stronger to support heavier cameras, or make different mounts for other cameras.

## Breakdown of the Articulated arm
### Mounting Base
First Part of the Articulated arm is the mounting base, it's a hexagonal shape with holes cut out for gluing of the shoulder base, and 1 hole for mounting it to a shelf, table or wall.

I recommend the arm be mounted only from above or below, because it was not projected or meant to be mounted to a wall.

### Shoulder base
The shoulder base is the part that is the interface between the mounting base and the shoulder joint that allows for the arm to rotate around.

### Shoulder joint
The shoulder joint is the part of the arm that allows it to rotate around, it also acts as the first joint in the arm so that it could be mounted and moved around.

### Arm joint
The arm joint is a single arm segment, it is meant to be printed at least once, and in the case of my needs is meant to be printed at least twice, but it can be printed as many times as necessary for your needs, there is not limit except the weight it can hold (which depends on how much you tighten it and how you print it).
